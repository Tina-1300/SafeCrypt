**SafeCrypt** is a modern PHP library that simplifies the use of cryptography via OpenSSL.

Currently **SafeCrypt** supports the following protocols :

- üîê RSA (asymmetric)
- üîí AES-GCM (symmetric, secure)
- üåÄ ChaCha20-Poly1305 (Fast and Safe Symmetric)

> [!TIP]
> ‚ú® Ideal for developers who want to use cryptography without getting bogged down in the technical details of OpenSSL.

**See [Installation](installation.md) to get started**.
